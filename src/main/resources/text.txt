PHILIPPINES--Internet giant YAHOO is aiming to increase its footprint in the
country by establishing brand partnerships with thousands of Internet cafes
scattered across the archipelago. Yahoo Philippines, which recently established
its local office, unveiled plans to set up "Yahoo-powered" cybercafes here. In a
recent interview with ZDNet Asia, Jojo Anonuevo, Yahoo Philippines' country
manager, said the company is "aiming to increase its presence, and in the
process, increase the Internet user population of the country". The Philippine
Internet market is unique, Anonuevo said, noting that current industry numbers
estimate about 70 percent of "netizens" in the nation get their access via
cybercafes.
